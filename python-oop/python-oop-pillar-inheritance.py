# Object Orientated Programming: Inheritance

"""
What is inheritance?
* Inheritance is one of the four fundamental pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), alongside Encapsulation, Abstraction,
 Polymorphism. It allows a class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class), promoting code
 reusability, modularity, and hierarchical structuring.

* It allows one class (child/subclass) to acquire properties and
behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class (parent/superclass).

* It promotes code reusability, modularity, and hierarchical structuring of code.
