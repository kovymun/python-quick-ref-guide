## PYTHON COMMENTS

What Are Comments in Python?

1. Comments are notes you write in your code that are ignored by Python when the program runs. They are written for
   humans, not for the computer.
2. Comments help you:

- Explain what your code is doing
- Make your code easier to understand later
- Help other developers read and maintain your code
- Temporarily disable code during testing and debugging.

### Single-Line Comments (#)

1. In Python, a single-line comment starts with the # symbol.
2. This is a single-line comment:

`print("I love coding in Python!")  # This comment explains the line above`

`age = 25 # Store the user's age`

3. Everything after # on that line is ignored by Python.
