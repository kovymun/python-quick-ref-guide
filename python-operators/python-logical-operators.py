Logical Operators
--------------------

1. Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions and return a Boolean value ("True" or "False").
   These operators are often used in decision-making and control flow statements like "if`" and "while (conditionals).

2. The three logical operators in Python are:
   a) "and" : Returns `True` if **both** conditions are `True`, otherwise returns `False`.
      **Example:** `(5 > 2) and (10 > 3)` → `True`
   b) "or" : Returns `True` if **at least one** condition is `True`, otherwise returns `False`.
      **Example:** `(5 > 2) or(10 < 3)` → `True`
   c) "not" : Reverses the Boolean value of a condition.
      **Example:** `not (5 > 2)` → `False`

3. Logical operators are often used with comparison operators (">", "<", "==", etc.) to create complex conditions.
