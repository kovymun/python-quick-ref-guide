# PYTHON OPERATORS

--------------------
Assignment operators
--------------------
1. Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. These values can be of different data types, such as strings, integers, lists, or dictionaries.

2. Some common assignment operators in Python include:
   a) "=" :Assigns a value to a variable.
   b) "+=" : Adds a value to the current variable and updates it.
      **Example:** `num += 2` is the same as `num = num + 2`
"""

# Example using Assignment operators
# Defining a name variable
name = "Kelvin Jones"

# Initializing a numerical variable
num = 1  # Initial number of parking tickets

# Using an assignment operator to update the value (+=)
num += 4  # Adds 4 to the existing value of num (1 + 4 = 5)

print(f"{name} has {num} outstanding parking tickets") # Output: Kelvin Jones has 5 outstanding parking tickets.
