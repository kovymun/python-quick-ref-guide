--------------------
Assignment operators
--------------------
1. Assignment operators are used to values to a variable. This values could be of type string, interger, even data structures like,
lists or dictionaries.
2. Some examples of assignment operators in python include:
a) =
b) += EXAMPLE num+=2 is the same as num = num +2
"""

# Example using Assignment operators
# Defining a name variable
name = "Kelvin Jones"

# Initializing a numerical variable
num = 1  # Initial number of parking tickets

# Using an assignment operator to update the value (+=)
num += 4  # Adds 4 to the existing value of num (1 + 4 = 5)

print(f"{name} has {num} outstanding parking tickets") # Output: Kelvin Jones has 5 outstanding parking tickets.
