# Python Identity Operators

"""
In this file we will explore the concept of IDENTITY OPERATORS in Python.

1. In Python, identity operators (is and is not) are used to compare whether two variables refer to the same memory location.
These are different from equality operators (== and !=), which check if the values of two variables are the same.

2. The is operator:
* The "is" operator checks if two variables point to the same object in memory.

EXAMPLE:
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]

print(a is b)   # False (Different objects)
print(a == b)   # True  (Same values)
