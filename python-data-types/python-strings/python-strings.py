Python Strings

1. What is a string data type? A string is a data-type usually used to represent a sequence of characters OR text. 
In Python, strings are enclosed in either single quotes ('), double quotes ("), or triple quotes (''' or " " ").

2. A "key feature" of strings in Python is that they are "immutable". This means that once a string is created, 
it cannot be modified in place. Any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string.

3. EXAMPLE: greeting = "Hello, Learner"
