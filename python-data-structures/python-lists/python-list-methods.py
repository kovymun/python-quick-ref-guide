Python List Methods
-------------------

1. A list method is a built-in function that allows you to perform different/various actions on a list in Python.
2. For example, list methods allow you to change, organize, or retrieve information from a list. Example: Adding, removing or sorting
items in a list.
3. Some of the most common list methods are: append(), extend(), pop(), remove(), and sort().

"""

# EXAMPLE: LIST APPEND METHOD
# The append() method adds an item x to the end of the list. In this example, we are adding the "cart item: apple" to the "cart" list.
cart = ["pears", "cactus"]
cart.append("apple")

print(cart) #Expected Output: ['pears', 'cactus', 'apple']
