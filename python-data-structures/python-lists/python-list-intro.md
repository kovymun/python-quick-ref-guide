1. Python has 4 built-in data types used to store collections of data. This section will focus on **Lists**.
2. What is a List? A **LIST** is collection of items that can hold different elements.
3. An alternate wat to describe a list is as a built-in data type in Python, that act as containers to store
   collections of data.
4. The list items are **ordered**, **mutable**, and can hold items of different data types (i.e. integer, or string).
5. Defined using square brackets [].
6. SYNTAX: `list_name = []`
7. EXAMPLE:

```
EXAMPLE: LIST HOLDING A COLLECTION OF FRUIT (OF TYPE STRING)
fruits = ["Orange", "Strawberry", "Apple", "Peach"]
print(fruits)  # Expected Output: ['Orange', 'Strawberry', 'Apple', 'Peach']
```
