## PYTHON LIST METHODS

### pop method

1. The pop method removes a list element at a specific position (index).
2. Another key point to remember, is that pop() does two things at once: it modifies the original list | and returns the
   removed value.
3. If no index is provided, the last element of the list is removed and returned by default.
4. It also modifies the original list in memory.
5. SYNTAX: `list.pop(index-position)`
6. EXAMPLE:

```
numbers = [1, 2, 10]
numbers.pop(1)  # Removes list element at index 1
print(numbers)  # [1, 10]
```
