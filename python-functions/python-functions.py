* What is a function?  
  - A function is a block of reusable code designed to perform a specific task or action.  
  - It helps avoid repetitive code by allowing the same function to be used multiple times in a program.  

* Understanding a Function's Interface:  
  - Arguments/Parameters: The input values passed into the function to customize its behavior.  
  - Return Value: The result or output produced by the function after performing its task. 

* SYNTAX:
    def function_name(parameters):
    # Function body (logic)
    # Return value*
